emberjs-template
================

Ember Template with SASS, and Require to work in rapid prototyping builds.

_modules :
	self powered elements that can run solo and automatically.
	* maybe UI stuff does not belong here * as those need 
	to know where to append to

_views :
	components of a page

_pages :
	full page views.

_wrappers :
	wrappers for certain libraries loaded with require

configs :
	all configuration files and information should exist in here.
	* some debate about dividing views from their controller objects. *
